# Valentine's Day Special LOL 💘😂  

As usual, I was mindlessly scrolling through memes—because what else would I be doing? But since today is **Valentine's Day**, the memes were all about love. 💖 And then, I stumbled upon one where some math genius used equations to spell out **"LOVE."**  

And as a **math geek**, my immediate reaction was:  
*"Why not give this a shot? LOL."* 🤓  

So, I fired up **Matplotlib** and started plotting the equations. But, of course, I couldn't stop there. I did a quick research and foud a **3D heart equation** (Equation Link: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-3D-shape-of-a-heart-with-equation-2_fig1_330496498) and thought, *"Let’s take this to another dimension!"*  

## 💡 What's Inside?
✔️ Love, but make it **math**.  
✔️ 2D plots spelling out **L-O-V-E** using equations.  
✔️ A **3D heart equation** for that extra touch of geeky romance.  
✔️ Screenshots of my *questionable* yet fun math choices.
